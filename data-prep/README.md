This folder contains all the data analysis and output to identify suitable sites for community solar and campaign zones (clusters of suitable sites).

There are two subfolders:
- **pgm**: contains all the .R scripts used in this analysis. Each script contains a number in its name showing the order they run in. Scripts often save permanent files to be used in the subsequent script.
- **dat**: contains all the data files generated by the programs in the **pgm** folder. All permanent files saved as part of running the 5-part progrmas are saved in this folder. All files used in the web map are also saved here in the for-web-map folder

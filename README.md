This GitHub repository contains the .R scripts and web mapping code for the interactive web map developed as part of **FCNY 2023-24 Community Planning Fellow** Henry Kanengiser's project with NYC 2030 District and RETI Center. The project spans the borough of Brooklyn, NY, though this code should be easy to replicate for all of New York City.

Henry conducted research for the two organizations to identify buildings that could serve as highly suitable sites for rooftop community solar as RETI Center expands its Local Power program. From this map of scored sites, we then developed **campaign zones**, geographic concentrations of highly suitable sites. Henry also developed a three-tier map of potential subscriber bases based on NY state and federal disadvantaged community (DAC) maps.

The .R scripts can be used to replicate almost all this analysis (there is a solar energy potential analysis that has to be conducted in ArcGIS Pro using its native tools) across all of NYC. The final script in this analysis saves information as shapefiles and as an .xlsx spreadsheet that can be used by outreach staff at RETI Center.

This repository also hosts the HTML, CSS, Java code, and **[website with an interactive map](https://henry-kanengiser.github.io/fcny-community-solar/)** that plots all the findings from this analysis. This website is designed to be used as an outreach tool along with the [site-analysis-brooklyn.xlsx](https://github.com/henry-kanengiser/fcny-community-solar/blob/main/site%20analysis_brooklyn.xlsx) spreadsheet.

There is one raster file of suitable rooftop areas across the borough of Brooklyn. that was too large to upload to GitHub. That file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yWBVyHt93tSxdTWlPd1XPLiuqe-dmvC-?usp=sharing).

The final report from this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8KHb42GYJB7AQWe59qKt4wDBq_-9EH7pqfoifi0AA8/edit?usp=sharing).
